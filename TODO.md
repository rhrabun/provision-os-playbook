## Todo

- [ ] Make use of `tags` - for example, dev_env tag installs only tools for development; personal tag installs everything including browser, pass manager, chat apps, etc. 
* per-role tags to run specific role
* Env tags to run specific tasks/configurations:
  * dev - development environment
  * user - personal use system
  * core - core utils ?
- [ ] SSH keys:
  * Encrypt with ansible vault
  * Store in private repo
  * Maybe after setting up ssh keys I can clone repos via ssh, not https
